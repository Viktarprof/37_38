nice to meet you Kate Chris um please
0:05
tell me a little bit about yourself I'm
0:07
currently finishing my masters of
0:08
education program at Lake Erie College
0:10
and working on transitioning from a
0:12
Northeastern Ohio inter to being a
0:15
member of the Jacksonville area
0:17
community why the move well my wife's
0:21
job is moving down south and I'm coming
0:24
along with her it's very noble and I
0:27
admire opal about you at the same time
0:30
um how did you hear about the position
0:32
open with our company here at REI well
0:34
when I thought about the opportunity of
0:36
changing locations and moving from one
0:39
physical location to another I thought
0:41
about making a career move as well and I
0:44
was starting with my main interests in
0:47
passions and I love being outside I love
0:49
doing outdoor activities and I love
0:52
working with people and I thought if I
0:54
could use my experience as a teacher
0:55
helping people and my interest in the
0:58
outdoors together that would be a good
1:00
place to start a new career and when I
1:02
was looking online I found aa reaiize
1:04
website and that there were positions
1:06
available in the Jacksonville area so I
1:08
thought I would apply great well you say
1:10
you have an interest in outdoor
1:12
activities so this would be a great
1:15
company for you to work at that being
1:17
said what else do you know about our
1:19
company well I know you've been around
1:21
for a long time since the late 1930s and
1:23
what really caught my attention the most
1:25
was the idea that it was started by
1:27
people who had a passion for the
1:29
outdoors and found a way to involve
1:31
others in their experience
1:34
I like the idea too that your company is
1:37
consistently ranked among the top 100
1:39
companies to work for by Fortune
1:41
magazine and I thought growing with a
1:43
company that has that level of success
1:45
would be a good place to be
1:49
why uh why do you want this particular
1:52
position here with on within our
1:54
customer service department because I
1:56
want to start in a position that allows
1:58
me to learn everything about the company
2:01
from the very basic level of interacting
2:03
with the customers all the way up
2:04
throughout the sales process the
2:06
marketing process and the production of
2:08
goods and services when I saw the
2:12
opportunity for customer service I
2:13
thought of the line very well with a
2:15
skill set that I have and also with some
2:17
skills that I could bring to the company
2:18
that might be me can you tell me a
2:20
little bit more about these skills that
2:21
you transfer from your previous line of
2:23
work to our department here sure an
2:26
education it's all about making the
2:28
customer or student feel comfortable and
2:30
helping them grow I feel that within a
2:33
company like REI it's the same
2:34
philosophy getting a customer
2:37
comfortable with the product and helping
2:39
them grow as they advance in whatever
2:41
sport they happen to be participating in
2:44
why do you think that our company should
2:47
hire you specifically amongst our pool
2:50
of candidates that are interviewing for
2:51
this position sure I think one skill set
2:54
that I have involves my background in
2:56
education teachers are among the highest
2:58
stressed professionals in the workplace
3:00
and REI offers a number of products that
3:03
help alleviate stress by getting people
3:05
outdoors and teachers also have a lot of
3:08
downtime in the summers my thinking is
3:10
that once I learn the ropes and advance
3:12
within the company I'll be able to
3:13
market the services and products that
3:15
REI offers specifically to the teaching
3:19
profession I have to ask this question
3:24
given that you are making a career
3:27
change here especially with finishing a
3:30
master's degree in education if a
3:35
position becomes available in your
3:37
current field down here in the
3:38
Jacksonville area how do you approach
3:42
being offered this job versus being
3:45
offered a position in your field and I'm
3:48
asking that in the now and in the future
3:50
sure that's a great question I'm not
3:52
pursuing further educational
3:54
opportunities within that profession
3:56
I feel like this customer service
3:59
opportunity the chance to work in a
4:01
field that I enjoy as much as teaching
4:03
is a place that I could grow into long
4:06
term okay so when I get out of teaching
4:09
is working with people and helping
4:11
people become a little bit better than
4:13
they were when I first met them and that
4:15
skill translates very well into re eyes
4:18
mission and so I don't anticipate
4:20
leaving a successful career for
4:23
something I've already done I feel like
4:25
this is a natural confluence of my two
4:27
interests Chris what would you identify
4:34
as your greatest professional strengths
4:37
oh I think patience is probably my
4:40
greatest strength that translates across
4:43
the careers being able to listen to a
4:46
student or customers difficulty and help
4:49
them overcome that difficulty with
4:50
patience and compassion my greatest
4:52
strength
4:53
would you consider any weaknesses that
4:56
you have to be detrimental to your job I
4:59
think there's a risk when it comes to
5:02
compassion I think people can
5:04
misinterpret compassion as being easy or
5:07
willing to roll over when it's important
5:11
to understand that compassion is
5:13
something that is is earned and it's
5:16
interactive and I feel like if I
5:18
establish clear boundaries with
5:20
customers clients students they
5:22
understand that I am understanding I am
5:24
patient I am kind yet I'm also going to
5:26
hold the people I interact with to a
5:29
high standard to date what would you say
5:33
is your greatest professional
5:35
achievement personally becoming a
5:39
teacher earning a master's degree those
5:41
have all been wonderful experiences for
5:43
me but the greatest achievement would
5:45
have to be working with young people and
5:47
helping them get a little bit better at
5:50
communicating with the world around them
5:55
Chris can you tell me about a challenge
5:57
or conflict that you've faced in the
6:00
workplace and how you would deal with it
6:02
sure within the education profession
6:05
there are challenges every day you're
6:07
dealing with hundreds of different
6:08
hundreds of different personalities and
6:10
interests and levels of enthusiasm so
6:13
being able to engage students with
6:16
content in an enriching way is part of
6:19
overcoming a conflict or difficulty I
6:21
think building professional
6:22
relationships is another way to deal
6:23
with conflicts understanding where
6:25
people come from prior to teaching I was
6:28
involved with a photography company
6:29
photographing events like weddings and
6:32
bar mitzvahs and very very important
6:35
events in people's lives and a lot of
6:36
times conflicts would arise so again
6:38
just like in teaching overcoming those
6:40
conflicts with patience and listening to
6:43
the client or customers needs is very
6:45
important now you are interviewing for a
6:47
position that is not an SP level
6:51
position and there is the possibility
6:54
that those in our company that were
6:56
overlooked for this position may have
6:57
some animosity regarding the new hire
7:00
for this position so how do you approach
7:02
this potential challenge here at the
7:05
workplace the important thing is to
7:07
listen to the people around me and
7:09
understand that I am a newcomer and that
7:11
they know more about the work
7:13
environment than I will coming in I
7:15
think because I have a friendly demeanor
7:18
and I'm not confrontational when meeting
7:20
new people that in time will have a
7:22
chance to earn each other's mutual
7:24
respect and understand that we both want
7:26
the same thing the company to grow and
7:28
us to grow within the company where do
7:31
you see yourself in five years
7:33
specifically here within our company
7:35
hopefully I'll be able to develop a
7:37
market that allows me to interact with
7:39
people within the teaching profession
7:40
and grow our brand using that market as
7:43
a target client base it's great
7:49
are you interviewing currently with any
7:52
other companies and if so what interests
7:55
you about those particular companies as
7:56
well since I'm new to the area I haven't
7:59
had the opportunity to interview with a
8:00
wide variety of companies I have looked
8:03
at Bass Pro Shops
8:04
and I'm currently scheduled to interview
8:05
with them they have a similar mission
8:08
and similar goals to REI it's just that
8:11
their product line is more specifically
8:12
tailored than organized or diverse
8:15
offerings we here at REI you know it is
8:21
being customer service there are aspects
8:24
of your job that are going to be a
8:26
little less active than I could expect
8:28
you being in a teaching position where I
8:31
assume you're on your feet more
8:32
one-on-one face-to-face with individuals
8:36
do you prefer a specific type of work
8:39
environment do you thrive in a variety
8:42
of work environments and what does this
8:44
look like
8:44
well I thrive in a variety of work
8:46
environments I wouldn't expect to be
8:48
sitting in a cubicle interacting with
8:49
customers unless I'm handling a phone
8:51
call and that's fine that's part of the
8:52
job but what I would expect is to be
8:55
actively engaged with the customers who
8:57
come into the store and helping show
8:59
them the products that might best suit
9:01
their needs and introducing them to
9:02
products that they might not have
9:03
considered before so what I've expected
9:05
to be up moving around and being
9:08
consistently engaged with a customer or
9:10
trying to find ways to improve what we
9:13
offer to our customers can you describe
9:17
a time for me ever that you may have
9:19
disagreed on a decision that was made
9:21
for you and staff members at work and
9:24
how did you deal with this sure within
9:26
the field of education there are new
9:28
initiatives being rolled out all the
9:29
time and sometimes those initiatives get
9:31
mandated you have to teach this way this
9:33
many times a week and when something
9:36
like that happens I think it's important
9:37
to go back to what you know about your
9:40
profession or your skillset and be able
9:42
to provide research that supports why
9:44
you do what you do and I think when
9:47
faced with a difficulty again it's
9:48
important to do what the boss says and
9:50
it's in
9:51
important to also advocate for what
9:53
might be best for the customer or
9:54
student alright we're going to move on
10:00
to some cognitive behavioral questions
10:03
and basically these questions are
10:05
designed they're not necessarily about
10:08
your past your experience they're sort
10:11
of out of the box questions and so just
10:15
do your best at answering them as we go
10:16
through this so if you were an animal
10:18
what would you be and why it's a tough
10:23
question I think considering the the
10:27
traits of my dog if I had to be an
10:29
animal I would certainly want to be a
10:31
domesticated dog they just have that
10:33
ability to love unconditionally they're
10:36
intensely loyal and they just provide so
10:40
many benefits to people it's something
10:41
I'd like to do in my life as a human -
10:44
great
10:45
the next question how many tennis balls
10:49
can you fit into a limousine tennis
10:53
balls in the limousine well I guess to
10:56
effectively answer that question I would
10:58
need some help how we need to know what
11:00
type of limousine because we're talking
11:02
about a stretch SUV that's a much larger
11:06
volume than a smaller limousine are we
11:08
talking to door for door I also don't
11:11
know what's in the limousine already
11:13
other people in there or is it empty
11:15
once I had those questions answered I'd
11:17
have to do some calculations about the
11:19
size of a tennis ball how much area or
11:22
how much volume it takes up calculate
11:24
the inside of the limousine and then
11:25
make sure the math works out I could get
11:28
that answer to you I just can't do it
11:30
off the top of my head
11:35
let me ask this final question are do
11:38
you have any questions for us well I
11:40
mentioned a couple times about being
11:42
interested in helping grow a market for
11:45
REI I'm just curious as a new employee
11:48
or someone starting out on the lower
11:50
level how open is upper management
11:52
hearing the ideas of an employee we do
11:56
try to have monthly meetings where we
12:00
meet with a variety of employees at
12:02
random so these aren't things that are
12:05
necessarily scheduled regularly they're
12:07
very they're very semiannual they're
12:11
very informal we do like to hear our
12:14
employees opinions about our products
12:17
especially and about marketing one thing
12:19
that we don't necessarily do is the
12:22
lower level positions that are dealing
12:24
maybe with collections or you know the
12:28
intake and distribution of customer
12:31
service calls we don't necessarily talk
12:33
to that group of employees very often
12:36
but I'd be very interested to hear your
12:39
opinions on that should keep you hired
12:41
for the position and maybe ways that we
12:43
can do better as well by reaching a
12:45
larger group of our employees to benefit
12:47
our company okay and the last question
12:49
for me what from your perspective is the
12:52
best part about working for REI I think
12:55
the work atmosphere with our company is
12:57
very welcoming and even in my position
13:01
and somewhat upper management those that
13:02
I work for that are above me they're
13:04
very we're very good to our employees
13:07
and I think because of the treatment of
13:09
our employees we retain employment it's
13:13
very easy for us to get things done
13:15
because people want to do their jobs I
13:18
have worked myself in positions where
13:21
I've worked underneath people who were
13:22
more tyrannical in nature and it's very
13:25
difficult to want to do more and go
13:27
above and beyond what you need to do in
13:29
those situations so I believe that
13:31
that's the number one benefit of working
13:33
in our particular company is the
13:34
atmosphere itself
13:35
thank you so much for your time kay
13:37
pretty so much take care
