A sense of purpose: Feeling that my work has meaning and is contributing to something greater than myself is essential. 
Having a clear understanding of the company's mission and how my role fits into that mission is crucial.
Work-life balance: Achieving a healthy work-life balance is important to maintain my well-being and overall productivity. 
Being able to manage my workload effectively and having a flexible schedule that allows for personal time is important to me.
Opportunities for growth and development: I value opportunities to learn and grow in my role. 
Access to training, mentorship, and career advancement are important factors in my job satisfaction. 
Being able to work on challenging projects and expanding my skills and knowledge is essential to feeling fulfilled in my job.

2. Why do you want to change job?

I'm excited about this opportunity because it aligns with my long-term career goals. 
I'm looking for a role where I can continue to grow and develop my skills, and I believe this position offers that. 
I'm also impressed with the company's mission and values, and I see myself contributing to its success. 
While I've enjoyed my time at my current job, I feel that it's time for me to take on new challenges and continue to grow professionally.

3. Describe things you want to improve in yourself.

I believe that there is always room for improvement, and I am committed to ongoing personal and professional growth. 
One area that I am currently working on is my public speaking skills. 
While I am comfortable speaking one-on-one or in small groups, I sometimes struggle with presenting in front of large audiences. 
I have been taking courses and practicing to improve my confidence and delivery. Another area that I am working on is my time management skills. 
I tend to be a perfectionist, and I sometimes spend too much time on one task, which can lead to delays in completing other tasks. 
To address this, I have started prioritizing my tasks and breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces.
I believe that both of these areas of improvement align with the requirements of the job, and I am committed to working hard to continue to develop these skills.
